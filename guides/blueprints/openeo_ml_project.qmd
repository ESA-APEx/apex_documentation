title: Machine Learning based EO mapping projects with openEO
---

# Relevant project categories

This blueprint documents an example architecture for projects that:

- Use machine learning models that involve a training phase and an inference phase.
- Optionally allow the user to retrain the model with user provided training data.
- Produce EO data products such as land cover maps, crop type maps, or other thematic maps.
- Can or aim to use an openEO processing backend that includes the input datasets that are relevant for the project.

# Example projects based on this blueprint

ESA [WorldCereal](https://esa-worldcereal.org) and [World Ecosystem Extent Dynamics](https://esa-worldecosystems.org) used a similar architecture as part of their project setup.

# Overview of the architecture

In this type of project, we typically identify these common processes:

- **Collection of reference data**: Gathering of in-situ measurements, expert annotations, or other reference data needed for training and validating the machine learning model.
- **Extraction of (preprocessed) training data**: Based on locations of reference data, extract corresponding preprocessed EO data.
- **Model training**: Using the extracted training data & reference data to train a machine learning model.
- **Model validation**: Evaluating the quality of the trained model using a validation dataset.
- **Map production**: Generating the map, either for a user defined extent, or at large scale (continental/global).

## Reference data collection

While APEx does not provide specific services for reference data collection, we do provide recommendations for storing the
collected data:

- Use STAC collections to organise and describe the collected reference data.
- Use cloud native file formats (e.g. GeoParquet) to store tabular reference data.
- Define a suitable structure to organize data files, that avoids both too many files and too large files.
