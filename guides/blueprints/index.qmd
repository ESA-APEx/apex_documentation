---

The goal of APEx is to support ESA EO projects in general, and to assist in making their results more interoperable and reusable
after the end of the project. This section provides blueprints for specific types of projects, outlining how to best leverage the
platforms and standards recommended by APEx.

The material is offered as guidance and inspiration, and is not intended to be prescriptive.
