Changing the look and feel of your web portal is an important step in making your site reflect your project's identity and
branding. The APEx platform provides several ways to tailor the appearance of your website, ranging from simple color
adjustments to advanced custom styling. This flexibility allows you to create a unique and professional presence for your
project while maintaining usability and accessibility.

### Customizing Color Settings

The default APEx template includes built-in options for adjusting the main colors used throughout your site. To access
these settings, navigate to **website settings** in the navigation bar and locate the **color settings** section.
Here, you can modify the primary and secondary colors to better align with your project's branding guidelines.

Changing these color settings will automatically update elements such as headers, buttons, and links across your website,
ensuring a consistent and cohesive appearance. This method is user-friendly and does not require any coding knowledge,
making it suitable for most administrators and editors.

### Adding Custom CSS

For more advanced customization, Drupal allows you to add custom CSS descriptors to further refine the website's appearance.
By entering your own CSS, you can override the default styles provided by the template and implement unique design elements
or layouts.

To add custom CSS, click **CSS** in the navigation bar and look for the option to include custom styles.

Please note that using custom CSS requires a solid understanding of web design and CSS syntax and requires additional
approval from the project administrator and APEx team. Additionally, be aware that extensive customizations may affect
compatibility with future template updates, and APEx cannot guarantee that custom styles will remain functional after
such changes.
:::

Custom CSS is a powerful tool for those who need maximum flexibility, but it should be used with caution and only when
the built-in settings are insufficient for your needs.
