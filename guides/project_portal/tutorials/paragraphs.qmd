## Check which paragraphs are available and which one you want to use

To add content and visuals on a web page, you must add paragraphs. The web portal template provides different options to
share your type of content.

Via this [showcase page](https://demo.apex.esa.int/en/tools/showcase-page), you can see all different paragraph options.
When adding a new paragraph, you will also see a preview of the design.

You can select paragraphs to add:

- Text
- Call to action
- Visual with text
- Embed (code)
- Partners (logos)
- Columns: to split content and/or visuals in two columns
- Download / publications
- Events
- Web forms

## Add a paragraph

Click **Add Paragraph** in the web page you wish to edit. You will see a preview of all available paragraphs. Select the
paragraph suitable for the content you would like to add.

Select the paragraph you need and click **Add**. You can now start editing the paragraph.
