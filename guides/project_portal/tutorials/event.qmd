You can easily add an event by adding a **basic page**.

When you create a basic web page and edit the **Date** settings in the page settings bar on the right, your web page is
listed as an event.

You can further edit the web page based on the content and visuals you need to provide.

## Add upcoming events

If you want to add a short list of the first upcoming events, you can use the **view** paragraph and check the
**upcoming events** checkbox.

## Add an event overview

If you wish to add a full events overview, you can create a separate (basic) web page and add an overview via the
**view** paragraph.

You can display the events in tiles and/or in a calendar view. For both options, you have to use the **view** paragraph.
You click a**dd paragraph** on the web page where you want to display the overview.

In the setting of the paragraph you select:

* Upcoming events: to display an overview in tiles
* Events calendar: to display a calendar view which will include all events you create
