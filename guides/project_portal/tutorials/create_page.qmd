## Add a web page

To add a new web page, you navigate to **content** in the navigation toolbar (menu). You have 2 options. You can click on
the menu **content** which leads you to an overview of all web pages – here you choose **add a page** – or you can also add
a page via the **content** dropdown menu  - here you click on the submenu **page** to create a new web page.

Via the content overview you can:

- See all web pages of the web portal
- Search web pages via the search or filter
- Add a new web page
- Edit web pages to add or change content
- Publish or unpublish one or more web pages

## Start building a new web page

Once you’ve selected to add a new web page, you can enter your **web page title and check the URL in the settings bar** on
the right to get started. The URL will be automatically generated by using the title of the web page. You can deselect
this option and enter a custom URL if needed.

Once these required elements are set, you can continue editing the web page by adding:

- **A banner image (optional):**\
You can add a banner image by navigating to the menu tab **Banner**. This banner image will be displayed on top of the web
page.

- **Edit intro text (optional):**\
The intro text will be displayed on the top of the web page. If you add a banner image, this text will be displayed on
top of this image. If you do not add a banner image, the intro text will be displayed with a white background. You can
also remove the intro text and build your web page with other paragraphs.

- **Add paragraphs:**
To build and design your web page, you need to add paragraphs. These paragraphs are building blocks you can easily use
to add text, visuals, code and links to your web page.

Click the **add paragraph** button to select and add the paragraph(s) that is (are) suitable for the content that you need
to add. You will see a preview of the paragraph design or check the
[showcase page](https://demo.apex.esa.int/en/tools/showcase-page) to see which paragraphs are available and most suitable
for your content.

More information about the paragraphs is available in the tutorial [Add content and visuals via paragraphs](./paragraphs.qmd)
