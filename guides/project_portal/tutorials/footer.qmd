The footer is a basic element of your web portal and will be available for you to edit. The footer will already contain
the required elements such as project acronym, full name and link to the contact page. As an administrator or editor, you
will need to add any other links such as:

* Legal web pages (privacy policy, cookie policy)
* Links to other web pages
* Social media links

The CTA button to navigate to the contact page will be provided automatically when your web portal is being set up.

## Add or edit navigation and legal links

To edit these links in the footer you need to select **structure > menus** in the navigation toolbar (menu).

You can add or edit the following links:

* **Footer first**: links that will be shown in the left column in the footer
* **Footer second**: links that will be shown in the right column in the footer
* **Legal**: links to legal web pages which will be shown at the bottom of the web page
* **Contact**

## Add or edit social media links

To add or edit links to social media accounts, you need to navigate to **website settings** in the navigation toolbar
(menu) and select **follow us links.** You can add links for Facebook, X, LinkedIn and/or YouTube.

After adding or changing links click **save configuration** to save and publish the changes.
