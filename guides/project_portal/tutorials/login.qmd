As soon as your web portal has been set up, you will receive an email from the APEx team containing the URL that
allows you to access the website and manage its content.

To manage the content of the website, you’ll need to log in first. This can be done by navigating to your project’s
portal login at `https://<project>.apex.esa.int/user`, which will present you with a login screen.

Click the **Log in with APEx** button to log in using your APEx account. You can choose one of your preferred
authentication methods, such as **EOIAM** or **EGI Checkin**.

Once logged in, you will be able to edit and manage your web portal via the
[Drupal CMS](https://new.drupal.org/docs/drupal-cms). Through the navigation toolbar at the top of your screen, you
can manage:

* Web portal settings (color, footer, legal and social)
* Menu/navigation
* Web pages
* Content
* Visuals
* Web forms
* Taxonomy
* CTAs
* Footer (including legal pages and socials)
