# Description

A concise description of the algorithm, its purpose, and its characteristics that is understandable to a broad audience.
The inner workings of the algorithm do not need to be explained, but the expected input and output should be clear.

# Performance characteristics

Provide a general description of the relative cost of the algorithm, and expected running time. Explain if high costs are
to be expected, or if this can be safely run over large areas. Compare to similar algorithms if possible. The discussion
here can remain qualitative, quantitative figures can be given in the example.


# Examples

Show images or plots of the algorithm in action, and provide links to STAC metadata files with actual output assets.
Include resource usage metrics provided by the platform.

# Literature references

Link to more technical documentation or publications on this algorithm or validation studies.

# Known limitations

List:
- Limitations in quality, that are inherent to the algorithm.
- Limitations to when and where the algorithm can be applied.
- Upper and lower bounds for parameter values, for instance the maximum area that can be processed in one job.

# Known artifacts

Using text and figures, illustrate known artifacts. This helps to manage expectations for your users, and allows them to 
implement additional processing steps to mitigate or avoid these artifacts.
