# Introduction

The following text provides an overview of the APEx interoperability and compliance guidelines. These guidelines are
specifically aimed at both algorithm providers and algorithm hosting platform providers.

This document starts by explaining the general concepts and terms that will be used throughout the text. Understanding
these concepts is essential for comprehending the subsequent chapters' guidelines and gaining a clearer understanding of
APEx's roles and responsibilities. The document also includes a list of online references supporting the outlined
requirements.

The guidelines then outline specific requirements for algorithm providers. This includes guidelines on how to structure,
implement, and document algorithms. These guidelines were designed with the explicit goal of facilitating the
streamlined integration of algorithms and workflows into APEx.

Furthermore, this text sets out essential requirements for algorithm hosting platforms. Ensuring compliance with these
requirements simplifies their integration with APEx. Consequently, this ensures hosting platforms can contribute more
effectively to APEx more efficiently and successfully.

The guidelines in this document also define combined service level commitments (SLA and OLA), including accompanying key
performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. These will serve to validate and ensure the compliance of these commitments.

Lastly, this guide explains in detail the federated business model utilized within APEx. Through providing comprehensive
documentation of this model, APEx aims to foster a precise understanding among all stakeholders and create a cooperative
environment.
