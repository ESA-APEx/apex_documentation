This section outlines the commercial aspects of algorithm hosting within APEx and will be further analysed and
documented by the APEx project.

## Algorithm Hosting Platforms

@tbl-businessmodel provides an overview of the requirements and guidelines for the algorithm hosting platforms to
support commercial algorithm hosting through ESA’s Network of Resources.

    <tr>
      <td>BM-REQ-01</td>
      <td>The algorithm hosting platform shall allow a fixed price per area unit.</td>
      <td>This requirement ensures transparent pricing for the user, for example expressed in platform credits per km², hectare or by number of products.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BM-REQ-02</td>
      <td>The operator of the algorithm hosting platform should support registering the algorithm in the ESA network of resources, with a cost per km², hectare or by number of products.</td>
      <td>This does not apply if the service can be invoked by the user ‘for free’, so costs are compensated by a different mechanism.</td>
