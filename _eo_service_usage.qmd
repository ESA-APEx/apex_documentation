## Under construction

The APEx will provide a web based user interface to discover and search available services. This interface is still
under
construction, so until that time, example processes can be found in
our [GitHub algorithm repository](https://github.com/ESA-APEx/apex_algorithms/tree/main/algorithm_catalog).

## Python service discovery

APEx provides a Python package to discover available services. The package can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip instal esa-apex-toolbox
```

The package allows to list available services:

```{python}
from esa_apex_toolbox.algorithms import GithubAlgorithmRepository


catalog = GithubAlgorithmRepository(
            owner="ESA-APEx",
            repo="apex_algorithms",
            folder="algorithm_catalog",
        )

catalog.list_algorithms()
```

This lists the names, but we are more interested in a more convenient overview of all properties. The library for
instance allows to construct a pandas DataFrame with all properties:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
algorithms = {name:catalog.get_algorithm(name) for name in catalog.list_algorithms()}

pd.DataFrame.from_dict(algorithms,orient='index')
```
