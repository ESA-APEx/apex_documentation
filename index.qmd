# Welcome to the APEx Documentation Portal

Application Propagation Environment (APEx) is a European Space Agency (ESA) initiative that aims to facilitate the uptake of Earth Observation (EO) data and services.

## For users

APEx curates a catalog of earth observation services, that generate value-added products on demand. This can be for instance
a service to detect deforestation, floods or generate higher level information. These services are built and maintained by
various EO projects, which guarantees that they have gone through an extensive review and validation process.

These services are offered through standardized interfaces, to allow users to easily interact with them. To learn more about
how to invoke these services, please refer to [EO service usage](./eo_service_usage.qmd).

## For ESA EO Projects

Here, you'll discover comprehensive guidance on APEx's instantiation services.
Explore detailed documentation on dedicated IT components, including project websites, data visualization tools, workspaces, and development environments offered as Software as a Service (SaaS) products.
Learn how to instantiate these cloud-based environments on demand and tailor them to your project's specific needs with our step-by-step guides and tutorials.

Learn the details of building efficient on-demand services via [APEx's propagation services](./propagation.md).
Gain insights into ensuring the continuous availability, enhancement, and upscaling of EO algorithms.
Delve into detailed instructions on leveraging interoperability standards like openEO and OGC Application Package to onboard algorithms with best-practice interoperability.
Explore our guidance on enhancing algorithm performance, facilitating intercomparison of scientific accuracy, and implementing cloudification strategies for existing toolboxes.


Navigate through our technical documentation to harness the full potential of APEx services and propel your EO projects to new heights.
