# Algorithm Onboarding Service

APEx offers an algorithm onboarding service as part of its propagation services to ensure that project results remain
accessible to the EO community beyond the project's completion. This service aims to sustain and promote the use of
algorithms developed during ESA projects, ensuring their longevity and continued utilization.

For engagement with stakeholders of the algorithm, APEx collaborates closely with
the [Stakeholder Engagement Facility](https://esa-sef.eu/). This initiative will provide outreach and training towards
users, to maximize the uptake of the onboarded algorithms.

By leveraging APEx’s Algorithm Onboarding service, you can ensure that your project’s innovations continue to benefit
the
EO community long after your project ends.

## Service Overview

### Hosting Platform Onboarding Support

APEx supports your project in selecting the appropriate hosting environment for your algorithm based on
the [APEx Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/algohostingenv.md). APEx also assists in the
onboarding process, ensuring that your algorithm is available for execution on the selected platform and ready for
further integration into the APEx Algorithm Catalogue.

### Automated Testing and Benchmarking

To maintain the integrity of the algorithms, APEx conducts automated testing and benchmarking in collaboration with the
respective project teams. This ensures that the algorithms remain functional and accessible over time.

### APEx Algorithm Catalogue

The Algorithm Onboarding service supports result propagation through an algorithm catalogue, facilitating easy
browsing and access to available algorithms. Users and other projects can also easily onboard their own algorithms,
fostering collaboration and innovation within the EO community.

The algorithm catalogue allows visitors to execute algorithms on the corresponding APEx-compliant hosting environment.
For more details, please refer to [this section](#execute-a-service-from-the-apex-algorithm-catalogue).

## Condiserations and Project Responsiblities

### Algorithm Maintenance

While APEx ensures the long-term availability of the algorithm within the catalogue, the creation, maintenance, and
updating of the algorithm remain the responsibility of the original developer or the open-source community.

### Algorithm Execution

Algorithm execution is carried out one of the respective APEx-compliant algorithm hosting platform. By default, APEx
does not provide direct access to processing resources on these platforms. However, projects can request processing
resources through [ESA's Network of Resources (NoR)](https://portfolio.nor-discover.org/). When resources are requested
for a specific algorithm, onboarded to the NoR, APEx can facilitate access to cloud processing resources on the
corresponding platform as a broker.

### Large-scale Data Processing

For large-scale processing tasks, projects can request additional support through
the [APEx upscaling service](./upscaling.md).

::: {.callout-note title="Disclaimer"}
APEx relies on the APEx-compliant algorithm hosting environments for algorithm execution and the provisioning of the
corresponding cloud resources. Users wishing to execute an algorithm will need a valid account on the relevant hosting
platform or make a request through [ESA's Network of Resources (NoR)](https://portfolio.nor-discover.org/).
