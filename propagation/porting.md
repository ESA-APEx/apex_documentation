# Algorithm Porting Service

The Algorithm Porting Service within APEx supports the transformation and packaging of
algorithms, ensuring they align with the
APEx [Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/index.md). These guidelines are designed
to ensure that algorithms are standardized and ready for integration into APEx via
the [Algorithm Onboarding](onboarding.md) service.

The goal of the Algorithm Porting Service is to provide additional technical support to guide your project in applying
these guidelines, helping you navigate the transformation of your EO data processing workflows into APEx-compliant
technologies.

## Service Overview

The Algorithm Porting Service is designed to assist projects at various stages of algorithm development, providing
expert guidance on making EO algorithms APEx-compatible. The service includes the following key
features:

### Initial Algorithm Analysis

The first step in the Algorithm Porting process is a thorough analysis of your algorithm to evaluate its readiness for
APEx compliance. This includes understanding the specific data inputs, outputs, and processing requirements of your
algorithm. Based on this analysis, APEx experts will recommend suitable technologies for implementing your algorithm,
ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with APEx’s ecosystem. Possible options include:

- openEO User Defined Process (UDP)
- OGC Application Package

This assessment phase ensures that your algorithm is mapped to the most appropriate APEx-compliant technology, setting a
clear path for its porting.
Another important outcome is an initial assessment of potential risks that may affect the outcome of the porting process. This allows the project technical officer and APEx ESA responsible to decide if porting can continue. 

### Support for Transforming Algorithms into openEO UDPs

For projects that already have established EO data processing workflows, APEx offers dedicated support to help transform
these workflows into **openEO User Defined Processes (UDP)**. This step ensures that the algorithm meets the
requirements set out in the APEx [Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/index.md).

Through time-limited expert consultations, APEx's openEO specialists will work closely with your team, offering hands-on
guidance and resolving any technical challenges. This support covers the entire process, from adapting your existing
workflow to ensuring it can be executed within an APEx-compatible environment as an openEO UDP.

### Packaging Your Algorithm as an OGC Application Package

Alternatively, if your algorithm is better suited for deployment as a cloud-native application, APEx can assist in
packaging it as an **OGC Application Package**.

## Pathway to Onboarding

Once your algorithm has been successfully ported into an APEx-compliant technology, the next step is to onboard it
through the [Algorithm Onboarding](onboarding.md) service. This step ensures that your algorithm is not only ready for
execution but also published in the **APEx Algorithm Catalogue**, making it accessible to a wider community. By being
part of the APEx ecosystem, your algorithm can be reused and scaled by other users and projects, significantly
increasing its visibility and impact. This approach helps to maximize the value of your work, fostering collaboration
and innovation across the APEx community.
