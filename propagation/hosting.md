# Algorithm Hosting Service

APEx offers an algorithm hosting service as part of its propagation services to ensure that project results remain
accessible to the EO community beyond the project's completion. This service aims to sustain and promote the use of
algorithms developed during ESA projects, ensuring their longevity and continued utilization.

For engagement with stakeholders of the algorithm, APEx collaborates closely with
the [Stakeholder Engagement Facility](https://esa-sef.eu/). This initiative will provide outreach and training towards
users, to maximize the uptake of the onboarded algorithms.

By leveraging APEx’s algorithm hosting service, you can ensure that your project’s innovations continue to benefit the
EO community long after project completion.

## Service Overview

### APEx Algorithm Catalogue

The algorithm hosting service supports result propagation through an algorithm catalogue, facilitating easy
browsing and access to available algorithms. Users and other projects can also easily onboard their own algorithms,
fostering collaboration and innovation within the EO community.

The algorithm catalogue allows visitors to execute algorithms on the corresponding APEx-compliant hosting environment.
For more details, please refer to [this section](#execute-a-service-from-the-apex-algorithm-catalogue).

### Automated Testing and Benchmarking

To maintain the integrity of the algorithms, APEx conducts automated testing and benchmarking in collaboration with the
respective project teams. This ensures that the algorithms remain functional and accessible over time.

### Support for ensuring APEx compliance

To ensure smooth integration, algorithms onboarded to the service must adhere
to [interoperability guidelines](../interoperability/algohosting.md). These guidelines ensure algorithms are constructed
to be published in the APEx catalogue, promoting their availability as reusable, on-demand processes aligned with FAIR
data principles. Through these guidelines APEx is able to link onboarded algorithms to their execution tools and provide
clear integration instructions. Projects can request additional support from APEx to guide them through this
process and to select the appropriate algorithm hosting platform.

### Integration into ESA's Network of Resources (NoR)

The service supports projects in making their algorithms APEx compatible for integration in ESA’s Network of
Resources. This enhances visibility within the EO community and offers
developers opportunities to generate additional revenue streams.

## Condiserations and Project Responsiblities

### Algorithm Maintenance

While APEx ensures the long-term availability of the algorithm within the catalogue, the creation, maintenance, and
updating of the algorithm remain the responsibility of the original developer or the open-source community.

### Algorithm Execution

Algorithm execution is carried out one of the respective APEx-compliant hosting platform. By default, APEx does not
provide direct access to processing resources on these platforms. However, projects can request processing resources
through [ESA's Network of Resources (NoR)](https://portfolio.nor-discover.org/). When resources are requested for a
specific algorithm, onboarded to the NoR, APEx can facilitate access to cloud processing resources on the corresponding
platform as a broker.

### Large-scale data processing

For large-scale processing tasks, projects can request additional support through
the [APEx upscaling service](./upscaling.md).

## How to use the Algorithm Hosting Service?

1. **Develop Your Algorithm**: As a project developer, ensure your algorithm is built according to the APEx
   interoperability guidelines for algorithm developers. This compliance ensures that your algorithm is compatible with
   APEx and can be easily onboarded and propagated after your project concludes. Learn more about these guidelines and
   how to implement your algorithm using APEx-compliant technology [here](../interoperability/algohosting.md).
2. **Onboard Your Algorithm**: Follow the detailed instructions on our onboarding page to integrate your algorithm into
   the APEx algorithm catalogue. This process will make your algorithm available for reuse within the EO community.

::: {.callout-note title="Disclaimer"}
APEx relies on the APEx-compliant algorithm hosting environments for algorithm execution and the provisioning of the
corresponding cloud resources. Users wishing to execute an algorithm will need a valid account on the relevant hosting
platform or make a request through [ESA's Network of Resources (NoR)](https://portfolio.nor-discover.org/).
