# Algorithm Hosting Service

APEx offers an algorithm hosting service as part of its propagation services to ensure that project results remain
accessible to the EO community beyond the project's completion. This service aims to sustain and promote the use of
algorithms developed during ESA projects, ensuring their longevity and continued utilization.

The algorithm hosting service supports result propagation through an algorithm catalogue, facilitating easy browsing and
access to available algorithms. Users and other projects can also easily onboard their own algorithms, fostering
collaboration and innovation within the EO community.

For engagement with stakeholders of the algorithm, APEx collaborates closely with the [Stakeholder Engagement Facility](https://esa-sef.eu/).
This project will provide outreach and training towards users, to maximize the uptake.

To ensure smooth integration, algorithms onboarded to the service must adhere
to [interoperability guidelines](../interoperability/algohosting.md). These guidelines ensure algorithms are constructed
to be published in the APEx catalogue, promoting their availability as reusable, on-demand processes aligned with FAIR
data principles. Through these guidelines APEx is able to link onboarded algorithms to their execution tools and provide
clear integration instructions.

Additionally, the algorithm hosting service supports projects in making their algorithms APEx compatible for integration
in ESA’s Network of Resources. This enhances visibility within the EO community and offers developers opportunities to
generate additional revenue streams.

By leveraging APEx’s algorithm hosting service, you can ensure that your project’s innovations continue to benefit the
EO community long after project completion.

## How to use the service ?

1. **Develop Your Algorithm**: As a project developer, ensure your algorithm is built according to the APEx
   interoperability guidelines for algorithm developers. This compliance ensures that your algorithm is compatible with
   APEx and can be easily onboarded and propagated after your project concludes. Learn more about these guidelines and
   how to implement your algorithm using APEx-compliant technology [here](../interoperability/algohosting.md).
2. **Onboard Your Algorithm**: Follow the detailed instructions on our onboarding page to integrate your algorithm into
   the APEx algorithm catalogue. This process will make your algorithm available for reuse within the EO community.
