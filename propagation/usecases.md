# Use Cases for APEx EO Service Support

The APEx services are designed to enhance the efficiency, interoperability, and scalability of EO workflows and algorithms. 
Below are several use cases that demonstrate how these services can be applied to support your EO project.

---

## Use Case 1: Transforming existing desktop software into an on-demand, reusable, APEx-compliant service

### Problem

* A project has been using desktop software to perform EO data processing tasks but now wants to deploy this software as an
[on-demand service](index.md#what-is-an-on-demand-service) in a cloud-based, APEx-compliant environment.

* A project is already utilizing APEx-compliant technology and seeks to integrate features from non-APEx-compliant, 
desktop-based software into their workflow or algorithm.

### Examples

* 

### Solution
The [APEx Toolbox Cloudfication](toolboxcloud.md) service aims to convert features from desktop based software into 
cloud-based services that adhere to APEx standards, enabling seamless integration with cloud resources and existing 
platforms.

### Outcome
Key features of the desktop software become accessible via openEO or as an OGC Application Package, allowing the project 
to utilize these features as reusable, on-demand services on existing hosting platforms.

## Use Case 2: Improving algorithm performance

### Problem
A project is experiencing performance issues when running its algorithm.

### Examples

* 

### Solution
The [APEx Algorithm Enhancement](enhancement.md) service provides support for optimizing your algorithm. Through a structured 
approach, the algorithm is analyzed and improved for better performance.

### Outcome
The algorithm's performance is significantly improved.

## Use Case 3: Transforming an existing openEO processing graph into an APEx-compliant service and onboarding it on the APEx Algorithm Catalogue

### Problem
A project has developed an openEO processing graph and seeks to:
* Enable the service for reuse as an on-demand service.
* Make it accessible through the APEx Algorithm Catalogue.

### Examples

* 

### Solution
The [APEx Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/algohosting.md) provide a starting point for 
algorithm and workflow developers to understand how to prepare their openEO processing graph for integration with the 
APEx catalogue. After preparing the processing graph, or if further assistance is required, the 
[APEx Algorithm Hosting](hosting.md) service can offer additional support with both the implementation of the guidelines 
and the onboarding process into the APEx Algorithm Catalogue.

### Outcome
The workflow is successfully onboarded into the APEx Algorithm Catalogue, enhancing its visibility and usability within 
the EO community as an APEx-compliant service.

## Use Case 4: Transforming a non-openEO based workflow into an APEx-compliant service and onboarding it on the APEx Algorithm Catalogue

### Problem
A project has developed a non-openEO based workflow and seeks to:
* Enable the service for reuse as an on-demand service.
* Make it accessible through the APEx Algorithm Catalogue.

### Examples

*

### Solution
This process requires the workflow developer to select one of the following options:
* If the workflow is not compatible with cloud-based environments and requires a desktop environment for execution, the 
project may consider using the [APEx Toolbox Cloudification](toolboxcloud.md) service. This will ensure that the workflow
is transformed into an APEx-compatible service, enabling its onboarding onto the APEx Algorithm Catalogue through the 
[APEx Algorithm Hosting](hosting.md) service.
* If the workflow is already implemented in cloud-based environments or complies with the 
[APEx Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/algohosting.md), the project can utilize the 
[APEx Algorithm Hosting](hosting.md) service for additional support in transforming the workflow into an APEx-compliant 
on-demand service and onboarding it onto the APEx Algorithm Catalogue.

### Outcome
The workflow is successfully migrated to an APEx-compliant on-demand service and onboarded into the APEx Algorithm 
Catalogue, enhancing its visibility and usability within the EO community as an APEx-compliant service.

## Use Case 5: Automating EO Data Processing Pipelines for Large-Scale Data Processing

### Problem
A project is currently testing and validating a data processing pipeline on a limited subset of data and aims to upscale 
this pipeline for production, large-scale data processing.

### Examples

*

### Solution
The [APEx Upscaling Service](upscaling.md) provides tools and support to assist projects in automating and scaling their 
data processing pipelines. A key prerequisite for utilizing this service is that your data processing pipeline must be 
APEx-compliant. The [APEx Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/algohosting.md) serve as an 
excellent starting point for ensuring your pipeline meets APEx compliance. If your project requires additional assistance 
in making the data processing pipeline APEx-compliant, the [APEx Algorithm Hosting](hosting.md) service is available to 
provide further support.

If your pipeline includes steps that are not compatible with cloud-based environments, you may consider using the 
[APEx Toolbox Cloudification](toolboxcloud.md) service to transform those components into modular APEx-compliant services.

### Outcome
A comprehensive data processing environment is established for your project, equipped with the necessary tools and support 
for scaling your EO data processing pipeline.
