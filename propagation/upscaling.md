### Algorithm Upscaling Service

The Algorithm Upscaling Service facilitates the execution of your openEO UDP or OGC application package based algorithm
over larger geographic areas. The service assumes that the algorithm is already efficient enough to operate cost-effectively
at scale.

The service primarily provides self-service tools that project teams or end-users can utilize to run an algorithm at scale, using
the processing capabilities of the platforms that are compatible with the service.
