title: APEx-Compliant Platforms
---

To offer your algorithm as an on-demand service, it must be available for execution on an APEx-compliant algorithm
hosting platform. Currently, APEx supports the integration of services on platforms that adhere to the
APEx [compliance guidelines](../interoperability/algohostingenv.md). It is important to note that this list of supported
platforms is expected to grow as APEx evolves.

## Supported Platforms

### openEO UDP

* [openEO platform](https://openeo.cloud)
* [CDSE openEO federation](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu)

### OGC Processes/Application Package

* [Geohazards TEP](https://geohazards-tep.eu/)

## Is Your Platform APEx-Compliant?

If your platform meets the APEx [Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/algohostingenv.md), and
you have onboarded your platform to the ESA Network of Resources (or plan to do that), we encourage you to reach out to
the APEx team to get it added to the list.
