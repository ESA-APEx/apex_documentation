title: Supported Platforms
---

This section provides an overview of APEx-compliant algorithm hosting environments based on the
[APEx interoperability and compliance guidelines](../interoperability/algohostingenv.md). The list includes platforms
available for each APEx-compliant technology, along with recommendations for environments that support the development
process of APEx-compliant services.

Throughout the project, APEx aims to expand this list of compliant platforms, offering users the flexibility to choose
their preferred platform.

## openEO User Defined Processes

An openEO UDP can be developed in any openEO-based environment using existing [openEO tools](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/).
APEx can support development activities by providing projects access to its [User Workspace](../instantiation/user_workspace.md)
and [IDE](../instantiation/ide.md) services. For testing the UDP, we recommend utilising an APEx-compliant hosting platform.
This ensures platform compatibility and facilitates the deployment of your UDP as an on-demand service. Currently, APEx
as identified the following platforms as compliant with the APEx guidelines:

* [openEO platform](https://openeo.cloud)
* [CDSE openEO federation](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/openEO/federation/openeo_federation.html)

## OGC Processes/Application Package

To develop and test an OGC Application Package, you can use one of the following environments, which include the necessary
tools and basic infrastructure to support the development process:

* [ELLIP](https://ellip.terradue.com/)
* APEx [User Workspace](../instantiation/user_workspace.md) and [IDE](../instantiation/ide.md) services

To offer your algorithm as an OGC API Process, APEx has identified the following platforms as compliant with the APEx guidelines:

* [Geohazards TEP](https://geohazards-tep.eu/)

## Is Your Platform APEx-Compliant?

If your platform meets the APEx [Interoperability and Compliance Guidelines](../interoperability/algohostingenv.md), and
you have onboarded your platform to the ESA Network of Resources (or plan to do that), we encourage you to reach out to
the APEx team to get it added to the list.
