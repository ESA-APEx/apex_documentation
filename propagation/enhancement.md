### Algorithm Enhancement Service

The Algorithm Enhancement Service starts with an assessment of your existing work, leveraging automated benchmarks and expert review
to enhance efficiency while maintaining the same quality within acceptable error bounds for your application.

This service always require an approval from the project officer to start an initial assessment of your work and the
feasibility of enhancement within a reasonable timeframe. Therefore, the more detailed input you provide in terms of code and
algorithm description, the more accurate the assessment will be, and the more likely it is that the service can be offered.
Applications that cannot be sufficiently understood within the assessment period, may be considered too risky for enhancement.

It's important to note that this service focuses on improving already good and promising algorithms. Therefore, provide
a compelling motivation for why your algorithm deserves the additional attention and effort.
