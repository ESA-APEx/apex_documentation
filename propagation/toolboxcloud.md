# Toolbox Cloudification Service

The Toolbox Cloudification Service focuses on porting functionality from existing (open source) toolboxes into the EO platform
targeted by your project. This service is designed to enhance the scalability and integration of your toolbox's features
within an APEx compatible cloud environment.

The process begins with an assessment of your request to estimate the effort required to cloudify the toolbox. The main
advantage of this approach is that the specific functionality will also become available as a modular building block for
other projects. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a compelling justification for why this feature deserves to be 'cloudified'.
