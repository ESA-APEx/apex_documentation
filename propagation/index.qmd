title: From Earth Observation Applications to Services
---

One of the primary goals of APEx is to facilitate the transition of Earth Observation (EO) R&D results into reusable,
scalable, cloud-based on-demand services. Currently, ESA EOP R&D projects generate a variety of results, including, for
example, EO-derived value-added products (raster or vector files, typically level-3 and level-4), workflows and
algorithms, or conventional (open-source) desktop software solutions. The APEx Algorithm Services focus on
transforming and optimising (i.e., propagating) resulting algorithms, applications, workflows and toolboxes and ensuring
their compliance with FAIR data principles. The preservation of these project outcomes is managed through the ESA
Project Results Repository (PRR), supported by other APEx services, such as the APEx Data Catalogue.

The vision for the ESA APEx initiative is to adopt FAIR data principles and ensure that project results remain Findable
and Accessible and that they become Interoperable and Reusable. For value-added products, this mainly involves ingestion
in an ESA-controlled persistent storage solution and exposing these products accordingly (using STAC and other
technologies).

Maintaining workflows and algorithms in a FAIR-compliant way requires the adoption of cloud service concepts and
implementations. Therefore, APEx envisioned a solution for workflows and algorithms that would make them available in a
public cloud (platform) in co-location with the key EO data archives as on-demand services using standardised web
service APIs. Users can then trigger these web services with their user-specific parametrisation to produce results for
an area and time frame of interest.

However, developing on-demand services can be challenging for many projects and depends heavily on the complexity of a
workflow/algorithm and its initial implementation. APEx intends to facilitate the transition to cloud-based services by
providing guidelines, best practices, and tools that support EO R&D projects in overcoming these challenges.

The algorithm services support provided by APEx involves various subcomponents, and their relevance depends on a
case-by-case basis. The APEx Algorithm Services comprise:

* [Refactoring](./porting.md) source code to an openEO process graph
* [Packaging](./porting.md) of source code to an OGC Application Package
* [Integration](./onboarding.md) of a service into the APEx Algorithm Services Catalogue
* [Cloudification](./toolboxcloud.md) of desktop toolboxes through a tailored approach
* Technical performance [optimisation](./enhancement.md), both on the source code or service level
* [Deployment and hosting](./onboarding.md) of a service in an existing EO platform
* Onboarding of a service commercial offering onto the [ESA Network of Resources](https://portfolio.nor-discover.org/)
* Preserving and ensuring long-term accessibility via the ESA Project Results Repository (PRR)

This support can also be visualised in a chart, illustrated in @fig-pathway. This chart
outlines the different pathways for projects to transform and optimise their algorithms into on-demand services using
the APEx Algorithm Services.

The main goal of the Algorithm Services is to guide projects in defining their pathway and providing support
throughout the various steps. This is accomplished through an initial analysis of the project's needs, resulting in a
tailored pathway that assists in the transformation from source code to on-demand EO services.
