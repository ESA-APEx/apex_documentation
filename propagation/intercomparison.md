# Algorithm Intercomparison Service

The Algorithm Intercomparison Service benchmarks various algorithms against each other, providing a quality metric for
EO services that implement the same capability. This aids end users in making informed decisions about which algorithm
to choose.

Additionally, it assists in identifying the most suitable algorithms for 'cloudification' or enhancement, ensuring that
only the most effective and efficient options are pursued.
