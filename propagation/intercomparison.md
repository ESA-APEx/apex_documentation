title: Algorithm Intercomparison
---

APEx facilitates algorithm intercomparison exercises, enabling the benchmarking of various algorithms against each
other, providing a quality metric for EO services that implement the same capability. This aids end users in making
informed decisions about which algorithm to choose.

Additionally, APEx assists in identifying the algorithms that would most benefit from cloudification or enhancement,
ensuring that only the most effective and efficient tasks are pursued.

The intercomparison activities are currently under development and will continue to evolve throughout the APEx project,
as it relies on APEx instantiation services and propagation services to provide the necessary tools and user interfaces
for conducting intercomparison exercises.

## Call for service providers

APEx is looking for a first category of algorithms to be intercompared. If you have an algorithm, consider onboarding it
using the APEx [Toolbox Cloudification](./toolboxcloud.md) support, and request your peers to do the same so that a first
intercomparison can be initiated.

If you believe your implementation outperforms one currently available in the APEx catalog, feel free to contact us.
We will further evaluate your case to determine if you have a potential candidate for intercomparison.
