# Project Portal Service - User Guide

## Introduction

The Project Portal Service will provide a solution designed to support the needs of projects by offering a project
website upon request. The portal, structured on a predefined base template, will offer the flexibility to further
customize the overall user experience. Beyond the initial theming options, the service incorporates a Drupal Content
Management System (CMS), empowering project members to perform advanced customizations and efficiently manage portal
content.

The instantiated project portal will have the option to work in synergy with other services offered within APEx. This
collaborative approach enables projects to extend their portal by instantiating other APEx services such as a
[STAC catalogue](catalog.qmd), a dashboard, a user forum, and more, and linking them to the main project portal,
resulting in a dedicated, streamlined project ecosystem.

## What does APEx offer?

APEx provides a default Drupal installation for your project, including a basic theme. APEx offers basic theming
support, such as changing the color scheme and project logo. Upon creation of your project's portal, an administrator
account will be created, allowing you to invite other project members. Using the built-in content management system,
your project is free to manage the content of the full website.

In addition to providing your project portal, APEx ensures optimal performance and availability through continuous
monitoring. Automated maintenance tasks, such as updates and backups, are conducted to minimize downtime and maintain
data integrity. This approach establishes a robust and dependable environment for users.

By April 2026, the APEx Project Portal Service will be integrated into the ESA Network of Resources (NoR). Until these
services are onboarded, projects can reach out to the APEx team to explore how we can support their hosting needs. APEx
also manages DNS setup, ensuring your projectâ€™s website is accessible on the internet without any additional technical
burden.

This comprehensive service allows projects to focus on content creation and management while APEx takes care of the
technical aspects, making it a valuable and efficient solution for project dissemination needs.

## What software is used by APEx?

For the project portal service, APEx uses the [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) framework. Drupal is an open-source
platform for creating and managing web content. In addition to its extensive content management features, it also allows
for detailed customization.
