title: Customisation
---

The APEx Project Environments are designed to adapt to the unique needs of each project. Except for the User Workspace and IDE
service, which are offered as a combined package, all other services can be requested and instantiated independently. This
modular approach allows projects to select only the tools that align with their specific requirements. Each service is
accessible via a public URL, enabling seamless integration into existing project components.

In addition to the flexibility of service selection, each service can be customised to reflect the project's branding and
aesthetics. The degree of customisation depends on the capabilities of the underlying software, typically focusing on general
visual elements such as logos and colour schemes.

Currently, customisation is performed during the instantiation process in close collaboration with the project team. As the
APEx project evolves, additional mechanisms to streamline and enhance service customisation will be explored. For projects
requiring more detailed adjustments, APEx will provide access to the softwareâ€™s technical documentation, empowering teams
to further tailor the services to their needs.
