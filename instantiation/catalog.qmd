# STAC metadata catalog user guide

## Introduction

Requesting a dedicated STAC catalog for your project, allows you to keep track of input data, intermediate results, and versions of final products.

If you don't know what STAC is, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the [basic concepts](https://stacspec.org/en) first.
Especially organizations responsible for data management or data processing in a project are very likely to have a need 
for STAC metadata. Also if FAIR data principles are important to you, you should consider using a catalog.

## What does APEx offer

You will get a dedicated STAC catalog, managed by the APEx team. This gives you full control over the metadata, without
having to worry about IT aspects such as security, backup or monitoring the service.
The catalog supports creating both private and public collections.

The data storage itself is _not_ included in the catalog. We recommend requesting object storage access with one of the
cloud providers in the NoR.

The catalog offers a REST HTTP API. It can be browsed visually using [STAC browser](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/?.language=en).

The metadata creation process is not automated. You will have to provide the metadata in a JSON format. The catalog gives
you full freedom in terms of STAC extension that you want to use.

## What software is used under the hood

The catalog is currently based on [stac-fastapi-elasticsearch-opensearch](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi-elasticsearch-opensearch).
The database is a managed opensearch instance running on open telekom cloud.

The APEx team can roll out software upgrades if needed, but cannot provide support for custom software development.
