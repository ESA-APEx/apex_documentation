## Overview

The Product Catalogue enables projects to create their own SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogue (STAC), which serves as a
comprehensive metadata collection for efficient organisation and discovery of geospatial data assets. This information
is presented in a user-friendly JSON format.

Instantiating a project-specific catalogue gives projects the freedom to use it for a range of purposes, from
experimental to operational use cases. Assets that are considered project deliverables will normally be added to the
centralised project results repository.

STAC structures data around assets, collections, and catalogues, simplifying search and access based on attributes such
as time, location, and other metadata. The concept of a STAC catalogue emphasises simplicity, operating as a REST-based
web service with a single HTTP endpoint for communication. This API-centric design ensures easy integration into
existing applications and tools, including other APEx services.

## Showcase Scenarios

The product catalogue serves several beneficial scenarios for projects:

* **Data Accessibility**\
  The service offers easy access to a wide range of geospatial data sources, enabling project teams to quickly locate
  and utilise relevant data without the need to manage large datasets locally.

* **Tool Integration**\
  By adhering to the STAC standard, the service enhances interoperability among different data sources, software tools
  and processing platforms such as openEO and OGC Application Packages. This ensures seamless integration of datasets
  from various providers, supporting comprehensive analysis and decision-making. This interoperability extends to other
  APEx tools such as the [Geospatial Explorer](geospatial_explorer.md),
  [Code Server IDE](app_code_server.md), [JupyterLab IDE](app_jupyterlab.md), â€¦.

* **Efficient Search and Discovery**\
  Users can efficiently search and discover datasets based on specific criteria such as time, location, and data type.
  This capability streamlines research, planning, and operational tasks by providing quick access to relevant
  information.

* **Enhanced Collaboration**\
  The service promotes collaboration by providing a centralised platform where project stakeholders can access and share
  geospatial data and analyses. This collaborative environment fosters innovation and knowledge sharing across
  disciplines and organisations.

## What does APEx offer?

### STAC Catalogue API

You will get a dedicated STAC catalogue, hosted and managed by APEx. This gives you full control over the metadata,
without having to worry about IT aspects such as security, backup or monitoring the service. The catalogue supports
creating both private and public collections.

#### Key Considerations

* **Data storage**: The STAC catalogue does include limited data storage. It is recommended to request object storage access
  from one of the cloud providers in the Network of Resources (NoR).
* **Metadata Creation**: The process of creating metadata is not automated. You will need to provide the metadata in
  JSON
  format, giving you complete flexibility in choosing the STAC extensions that best suit your requirements.

#### Underlying Technology

* **Software**: The catalogue is powered
  by [stac-fastapi-elasticsearch-opensearch](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi-elasticsearch-opensearch).
* **Database**: It uses a managed OpenSearch instance hosted on Open Telekom Cloud.

While the APEx team handles software upgrades when necessary, please note that support for custom software development
is not provided.

### STAC Browser

In addition to the STAC Catalogue API, APEx provides a dedicated STAC Browser to support the visual exploration of your
catalogue's content. This browser is seamlessly integrated with the instantiated API and is automatically configured upon
initialization to display the results published in your STAC API.

#### Underlying Technology

The STAC browser is built on the
well-known [Radiant Earth's STAC browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser), an open-source project
designed to enable interactive exploration of STAC catalogs. This web application can be customized to
meet specific user needs, offering flexibility for a wide range of applications.

## How to integrate the catalogue in your project architecture

The role of the STAC catalog, is in essence to facilitate data discovery and exchange between different components in
your project. By the use of a shared metadata language, components can be decoupled and still work together. It allows
different project partners also to work together, even if they use different software stacks.

We list some common cases below.

### Data set viewing

Data viewing is one of the most basic use cases. Most viewer implementations traditionally require to ingest data in a
viewer specific database. However, when metadata is sufficiently rich, and the viewer understands STAC, it can directly
query the STAC catalog, as long as it's sufficiently responsive for the low latency requirements of the viewer.

### Data processing

In the most basic case, a processing component simply stores final products in the catalog. Sufficiently advanced
processing systems will immediately generate STAC metadata, and may even allow writing into the catalogue API directly.
They also record data provenance, which is a key aspect of FAIR data principles.

In a more advanced case, the processing workflow requires storing intermediate products, or preprocessed ancillary data
sets. Also then, the STAC catalogue can be used to keep track of these data sets. By doing so, the processing component
can simply read required inputs from STAC, and store (intermediate) results back into the catalog.

### Machine learning datasets

A more advanced but increasingly common use case is to use a catalogue to track reference data sets, as well as training
patches in a STAC catalog. Here we again have a pattern where various components like the EO processing system, model
training scripts and reference data management system all work together around a central metadata store.
