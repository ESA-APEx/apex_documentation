title: User Forum
---

## Overview

The User Forum enables projects to request their own user forum on demand, providing a critical tool for community
building and user support. By offering a dedicated space for discussions, the forum allows the project, its
stakeholders, and users to interact seamlessly, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. This interaction not
only aids in addressing user concerns and questions but also encourages the sharing of knowledge and best practices
among members.

The underlying technology for the forum service is [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), a widely used open-source
forum software renowned for its robustness and flexibility. Discourse has been successfully implemented in various ESA
projects, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness. One of the standout features of Discourse is its
comprehensive admin interface, which empowers projects to customise the user forum to meet their specific requirements.
This customisation can include modifying the forum's appearance, setting user permissions, and managing content.
Moreover, Discourse supports a wide range of plugins that can significantly enhance the forum's functionality, providing
a versatile solution that can adapt to the evolving needs of any project.

## Showcase Scenarios

A user forum can support several project scenarios, including:

* **Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**\
  Forums bring together experts, researchers, and enthusiasts to share knowledge and insights, fostering a collaborative
  environment. Users can post questions and receive answers from the community, helping to solve problems more
  efficiently.

* **Community Building**\
  Forums help build a sense of community among users who share a common interest in the project. Users can connect with
  others, potentially leading to additional collaborations and partnerships.

* **Feedback and Improvement**\
  Project members can receive direct feedback from users, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of the
  project tools and methodologies. Users can suggest new features or enhancements, ensuring the project evolves
  according to user needs.

* **Support and Training**\
  Forums provide a platform for users to seek technical support and troubleshooting assistance. Users can participate in
  discussions to enhance their skills and knowledge.

* **Awareness and Outreach**\
  Forums can be used to disseminate information about project updates, events, and relevant news.
