title: User Workspace
---

## Overview

The User Workspaces within the APEx Project Environments provide secure, personalised environments for individual users to
perform a wide range of tasks, including development, data processing, visualisation, and analysis. These single-user
environments are managed by JupyterHub and dynamically provisioned using Kubernetes, ensuring scalability, isolation,
and ease of use. Key features and capabilities of the User Workspaces include:

* **Secure, Isolated Environments**\
  Each user is provided with a dedicated namespace within the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring resource isolation and secure
  data management.

* **Customisable Workspaces**\
  Workspaces can be tailored to user needs with specific configurations and tools, including pre-configured environments
  for tasks like data analysis and machine learning.

* **Seamless Integration with APEx Tools and Services**\
  Integration with other APEx tools, such as the [Interactive Development Environment (IDE)](ide.md)
  and [Product Catalogue](catalog.qmd), for enhanced functionality and data accessibility.

* **Robust Data Management**\
  Secure storage and retrieval of data and integration with external data sources

## Showcase Scenarios

The User Workspaces support a variety of use cases, making them versatile tools for the EO community. Some typical
scenarios include:

* **Development and Testing**\
  Researchers and developers can use the User Workspaces to develop and test new algorithms and models. For instance, a
  user might leverage the IDE integrated with JupyterHub to write and debug Python scripts for processing satellite
  imagery.

* **Data Analysis and Visualisation**
  \Analysts can perform exploratory data analysis and create visualisations using tools like JupyterLab or QGIS. For
  example, an analyst might use Jupyter notebooks to analyse climate data and visualise trends over time.

* **Educational and Training Purposes**\
  The User Workspaces can be used to create interactive tutorials and practical assignments that guide users through
  various aspects of APEx, from setting up workspaces and accessing data in the Product Catalogue to using the IDE for
  development tasks.
