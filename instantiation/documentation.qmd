title: Documentation Portal
---

## Overview

The APEx Documentation Portal enables projects to effortlessly create and host a documentation portal
utilising the open source [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) framework. Quarto is a comprehensive open-source system designed
for scientific and technical documentation, using Markdown as the primary editing language and supporting the
visualisation of both Jupyter and R notebooks. The proposed approach is complementary to hosting documents in PDF or
Word format on the web portal. It offers significant advantages over these traditional formats, especially for technical
writing with scientific plotting and code snippets. It also allows for introducing interactive elements in
documentation. Projects that do not feel comfortable with an approach based on Markdown for editing and Git for
versioning are still free to use those traditional formats.

Quarto generates fully customisable online documentation portals tailored for scientific publications, featuring
interactive visualisations. It supports various scientific elements, including formulas, diagrams, and code.
Additionally, Quarto can produce PDF or Word documents, making it ideal for scenarios where user documentation needs to
be transformed into a project deliverable.

The content of the documentation portal is managed through either a new or existing GitHub repository. This allows
portal managers and editors to edit the content in a well-known and familiar environment. Although some technical
documents may be stored externally, Quarto enables referencing of these documents within the documentation portal.
Additionally, thanks to the capabilities of GitHub, projects have the option to employ their own QA processes by
leveraging branching, issues, and pull requests. Using GitHub Actions, the latest changes to the content will be
automatically synchronised to the documentation portal.

## Showcase Scenarios

A documentation portal can support several project scenarios, including:

* **User Manuals and Guides**\
  Develop and store user manuals and guides for any tools or software created during the project. This ensures that
  users can effectively utilise the provided tools.

* **Training and Onboarding**\
  Create and store training materials, tutorials, and onboarding guides for new team members or external visitors. This
  helps them quickly understand the project scope, tools, and processes.

* **Technical Project Documentation**\
  Maintain detailed technical documentation, including software code samples, algorithm descriptions, system
  architectures, and hardware specifications. This is essential for sharing technical information within the project.

* **Research and Analysis Documentation**\
  Document methodologies, analytical processes, and research findings. This helps ensure the reproducibility of results
  and provides a reference for future research.

* **Project Planning and Management**\
  Store project plans, timelines, milestones, and deliverables in the documentation portal. This keeps everyone informed
  about project progress and deadlines.

## What does APEx offer

APEx provides a simple template to start your documentation. As you make changes, automation tools publish the
documentation to a location that seamlessly integrates it in your project portal. This works best in combination with
the 'project portal' service, ensuring maximal integration.

## What software is used under the hood

The open source [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) software is used, and you will need to learn the basics of that system. In
our own experience, people familiar with Markdown will have no issues with making basic edits. More advanced features
are well-documented, and often turn out to be easier to use than the equivalent in office tools. Many features are
simply not at all supported by such tools.
