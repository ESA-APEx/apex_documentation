# Documentation portal user guide

## Introduction

Most EO projects have various deliverables related to documentation. This can be user guides, design documents or algorithm theoretical basis documents.

The most commonly used approach to this in ESA EO projects, is to use well-known office tools and export the documents to PDF for upload to 
a website. While this approach is not necessarily wrong, and uploading documents to the APEx project portal is certainly
possible, we also want to offer an alternative for projects that are looking for a more modern approach.

The solution we offer is also well-known, and based on the use once you know how to do a particular thing, you of the simple 'Markdown' language to write documentation 
without worrying about templates and layout. The Markdown variant used is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and supports
advanced use cases for scientific and technical writing. It produces various outputs, allowing you to publish user documentation
to a website for your users, while also being able to export to PDF or Word for generating deliverables.

The content of your documentation is tracked on Github, allowing you to collaborate with your consortium partners using
pull requests. Full version control is available, avoiding the loss of content or typical issues caused by multiple authors
working in the same document.

You can use the online Github edit mode for quick changes, but can also do fully local editing,
including a preview mode to show the rendered document.


## What does APEx offer

APEx provides a simple template to start your documentation. As you make changes, automation tools publish the documentation
to a location that seamlessly integrates it in your project portal.
This works best in combination with the 'project portal' service, ensuring maximal integration.

## What software is used under the hood

The open source [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) software is used, and you will need to learn the basics of that system.
In our own experience, people familiar with Markdown will have no issues with making basic edits. More advanced features
are well-documented, and often turn out to be easier to use than the equivalent in office tools. Many features are simply not
at all supported by such tools.
