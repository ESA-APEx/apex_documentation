# ESA EO project support services

Many ESA EO projects require the same set of basic services: a website, data viewer, forum, Jupyter notebooks,...
Such services can now be requested from APEx, using NoR sponsoring. This avoids having to spend time on basic IT work, 
and allows project partners to focus on earth observation applications.

The following services can currently be requested from APEx:

- Forum
- Website
- STAC metadata catalog
- Geospatial data explorer
- JupyterLab environment
- Hosted QGis
- VSCode IDE
